      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>Our mission is to introduce people to the exciting sport and lifestyle of climbing. 
        Beyond just a physical challenge, 
        climbing is a mental puzzle, bringing us stimulation, and personal growth. 
        We're passionate about sharing that love and supporting everyone as 
        they push their limits and reach new heightsâ€”both on and off the wall.</p>

        <h1>Community</h1>
        <p>
          We hope to enrich the Edmonton climbing scene by making climbing accessible with a supportive environment and engaging activities. 
          In time, we aspire to expand beyond Ainlay into other schools, and eventually 
          organize outdoor climbing trips that inspire adventure and connect students to the beauty of climbing in nature. 
          Ultimately, our aim is to create a tight-knit community that helps students grow in climbing, but also thrive in life through challenge, discovery and cooperation.
