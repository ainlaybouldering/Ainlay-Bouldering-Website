  <h2 id="info">General info</h2>
  <p>We are currently planning to hold meetings once every two weeks. We will
    meet outside of exit 17, near the outdoor classroom. We will be leaving for Blocs at 3:15.
    Caito and Eric will stay at Blocs until around 6:30 pm, at which point we will go home.
    Members are free to come and go as they please. We will also be holding
    bouldering workshops during some meetings to help members improve.

  <h2>Location</h2>
  <p>We will be going to Blocs bouldering gym, located at 8761 51 Ave NW, Edmonton, AB T6E 5H1.
    Blocs is a bouldering-only gym, meaning there are no ropes or harnesses. This makes it
    perfect for beginners and experienced climbers alike. The gym has a wide variety of problems
    ranging from very easy to extremely difficult. There is also a small weight room and a yoga
    studio.

  <h2>Transportation</h2>
  <p>We are going to be bussing from Harry Ainlay to blocs. If you have
    transportation of your own, feel free to drive yourself and your
    friends there! In the cold winter months, we may have to cancel meetups if the weather
    gets dangerously cold. You will, unfortunately, have to arrange your own ride home, as 
    transporation is too expensive.

<section class="section">
  <h2>Costs</h2>
  <p>We are currently working on getting a group discount for members of the club.
    The regular price for bouldering at Blocs is $22 including rental shoes.
    We will update this section when we have more information.
