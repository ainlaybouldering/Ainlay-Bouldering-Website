      <p>We plan to hold competitions with small prizes(e.g rolls of tape, one free entry pass, 
        instant noodles, drinks) semi-regularly. 
        Every three months, we will be holding a competition with a medium prize(around $50). 
        At the end of the year, we will be holding a large competition 
        with a raffle prize of climbing shoes worth over 200 dollars and other smaller 
        prizes for the winners. All competitions will be cost free to enter and open to all members of the club.<br><br>
        More information will be released in the future. The first competition will be held sometime near the end of October.
